How to Play Tic-Tac-Toe (2-Player)
This is a two-player, gesture-controlled game that connects two computers directly.

IMPORTANT: The person who will be the Host might need to allow Python through their firewall (like Windows Defender) when they first run the script. This is necessary for the Client to connect.

Player 1 (Host) Instructions:
Run the script: python tic_tac_toe_2p.py

When prompted, type host and press Enter.

Your local IP address will be displayed. Send this IP address to Player 2.

Wait for Player 2 to connect.

Player 2 (Client) Instructions:
Run the script: python tic_tac_toe_2p.py

When prompted, type client and press Enter.

When asked for the IP, enter the IP address you received from the Host and press Enter.

The game will start!

Game Controls:

Player X: Use a "Peace" sign (two fingers) to place your 'X'.

Player O: Use an "OK" sign (thumb and index finger together) to place your 'O'.
